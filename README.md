### A website for matching two soulmates ###
Hey *Guys* it's been a while and since you all have learned a lot of things till now it's time </br>  to put your skills to test. So what is this **project** going to be all about, well it's *pretty simple*.</br>
You are required to make a 
- [ ] Matrimonial/Dating Website 
- [ ] Based on Profile Matching
- [ ] Responsive and Intuitive</br>
Well those are some *really big words* thrown randomly here and there so let's break it down for you guys. </br>
## Requirements ##
- The Website should have user authentication involved.
- User can change his/her/it's profile at their heart content.
- The profile should have all there **personal details** like those required in any matching websites.
[ *For more details visit the following links* ] [Tinder](https://tinder.com/?lang=en) [Shaadi.com](https://www.shaadi.com/)
- The website should be responsive in nature go crazy on the frontend side (*Implement* `Ajax` `DOM` `JQuery` it's all in your hands)
- User should have  the option  to put a filter on it's searches.
- ### In a Nutshell ###
> User should fill their profile after filling their profile they go to the home page.
> In the home page they see the profile of other users based on their **interest listed in the profile** and on the basis of **filters they apply**.
> The profile of other users shown will be completely random and no algorithm is required but the prior conditions should be satisfied. Now if the user wants he can choose `smash` or `pass` and then the request is sent to the other user who can *accept* or <del>decline</del> their request.
- Mails should be sent when it seems **neccessary**
- **Fork** this repo in your github and then start working.
- All the work needs to be done in **forked repository** and make a new branch where you will continue working.
- `git clone` `git checkout` `git add` `git commit` `git push` `git remote` these lines will be very useful for you all.
- When satisfied with your work send one final `pull request` to the original repository which after being accepted means that you can't more to the project now.
- **Work which is not reflected on your required branch after being pulled won't be accepted.**
## Key Takeaways ##
- I have been very vague about the details because I want y'all natural input in this task. You are a developer and it's your duty to fullfill the client requirements.
- Consider me as your client and then work on this project because it is not neccessary for the client to know the technical keywords which are required for this communication to take place.
- The more logical and responsive your site will be more it will be preferable for us.
- Complete the task in the deadline provided because deadlines do matter.
So guys let's get started-
```python
def home(request):
  return render(request,'base.html')
```
